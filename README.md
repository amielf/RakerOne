Git for Spring 2021 Team 2 Capstone Project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute

The Project is simulation of a Autonomous Trash Pick Up System meant for sorting and pick up of trash along roads and highways.  Only portions of the overall design concept was simulated.  Specifically the portions of the system that was implemented were:

- Trash/Litter Classification using Deep Learning with Yolo  (Brian Slagowski, Ryan Ferrin)
- A simplified Terrain Assessment method to support Local and Global Navigation simulated with ROS/Gazebo  (Amiel Fernandez, Seth Hanson)
- Implementation and Simulation of a Worker Unit Coordinator using Pygame  (Tanuj Sane, Ryan Ferrin)
- Manipulator Navigation simulated with MATLAB (Nicholas Longworth, Seth Hanson)
