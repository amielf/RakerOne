This folder contains the MATLAB code used to perform RRT based navigation around static obstacles that would be representative of how a Kinova based robotic arm would function as part of the RakerOne system.

The RRT tutorial in MATLAB is complete and needed few changes - though original plans to mesh the MATLAB based planner with a Gazebo visualization was not completed.  Final visualizations of the arm movements were performed in MATLAB as well and can be see in the MATLAB RRT recordings in the drive link.  A copy of code is also available in the drive along with referenced research.
